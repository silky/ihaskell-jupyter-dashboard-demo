# Control.Dashboard


A haskell library that queries the bitbucket API to get information that we might want to see on a dashboard.

## Building

Get [Haskell Stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and simply run `stack build`. (If this is your first time using stack, you may need to run `stack setup`).


## Running

You can run it using `IHaskell` or directly with

````
stack build && stack exec -- dashboard-stuff-exe
````
